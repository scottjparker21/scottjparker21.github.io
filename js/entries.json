At this point I was faced with the challenge of what to do next.<br><br>This first thing I had to overcome was unemployment. I had quit my job at PF Changs to concentrate on my final semester and did not want to go back. I spend everyday applying for graphic design jobs and continuing to build my portfolio. After what seemed like an eternity I was offered a intern position at a company in Burlington. While at times it was tedious and boring I’m thankful for everything I learned and the opportunity to work in an office environment.<br><br>When my internship ended I was lucky enough to get a job at Lakefront Brewery. The plan was to work there until I figured out my next move. I’m thankful for all the friends I’ve made while working there and for the flexibility they’ve allowed while I took the next step in life.<br><br>Which brings me to the latest challenge in my life. DevCode Camp has been a rewarding experience thus far. I’m thankful for the support of my friends and family over the past few months. It has been simultaneously the most challenging yet rewarding experience of my life."
