              <p>I was born in 1991 in Naperville Illinois. One year later my parents moved to Williams Bay Wisconsin, a town with a population of about 2,000. When I graduated highschool I went to art school in Chicago. In 2012 I moved to Madison and pursued a degree in graphic design. After two years it was time for a change. I moved Milwaukee in the Fall of 2012. I graduated in the spring of 2015.</p>

              <p>Since I graduated last winter I've had a few different jobs. In March of 2015 I started a three month internship at Lavelle Inudstries in Burlington, WI. I worked under the lead graphic designer making pamphlets, flyers, POP items, and packing designs. When my internship ended in May I got a job at Lakefront Brewery where I'm still currently employed.</p>

                  <p>I’ve been playing guitar since high school but never really took it seriously. In high school I mostly played bass and was in a couple horrible bands. During my college career I concentrated on guitar a lot more and in the Spring of 2014 me and a few friends formed a band and have been practicing and playing shows regularly ever since. Over the past couple of months my roommate and I have been writing and recording songs for a new project.

                <h3 id="skateboarding"> Skateboarding </h3>
                  <p>Skateboarding has also been a huge part of my life. My dad bought me a board for my birthday when I was 11 and I've skated ever since. In high school it was part of my everyday life. I met many of my good friends through the sport and it’s a big part of who I am. Recently I haven’t really had the time to get on the board much but it’s still a great outlet and I like to think that i’ll do it as long as my body permits.

                <h3 id="bicycling"> Bicycling </h3>
                  <p>Some people look at biking as a necessity or a form of transportation. I view it more as a hobby and a great way to get exercise. Growing up my Dad and I would go mountain biking in Kettle Moraine on the weekends. When I moved to the city I realized that a mountain bike isn’t the most practical way to get around. Over the past few years I’ve bought a couple beat up road bikes and fixed them up. I enjoy working on bikes almost as much as riding them.
