              <p>I was born in 1991 in Naperville Illinois. One year later my parents moved to Williams Bay Wisconsin, a town with a population of about 2,000. When I graduated highschool I went to art school in Chicago. In 2012 I moved to Madison and pursued a degree in graphic design. After two years it was time for a change. I moved Milwaukee in the Fall of 2012. I graduated in the spring of 2015.</p>

              <p>I have quiet a few hobbies. I enjoy playing guitar, riding my bike, and skateboarding. Recently I've started experimenting with fermentation and spend much of my free time making beer, kombucha, and various pickled items. Art is something I pursue in a variety of forms. I draw, sculpt, and paint digitally.</p>
